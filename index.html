    Problem statement: build star pattern.

    ## Requirements:
    Que: What are the features that we want in that project.

    Must have features:
        1. Rating from 1 to 5.
        2. When we click -> rating should appear.
        3. A hover effect should be there even after click?

    Good to have features -> optimzation, accessibility. 
        1. Can we put emojies instead of numbers.
        2. Slider based rating.


    Approach:
        1. HTML/CSS
           Prepare with basic/static HTML/CSS.
        
        2. Javascript.
           a. We have to listen to three events.
            i. Click -> Give the rating.
                        Update star upto taht level.
                        Update rating count.
            
            ii. mouseover -> we have to change the star upto that level to yellow without changing the rating once rating is given.

            Edge case:
            iii. mouseleave: move it gray stars.
